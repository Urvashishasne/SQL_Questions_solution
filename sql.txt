Que: Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing 
Charlie's old broken wand.
Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number 
of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. 
Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's 
interested in, sorted in order of descending power. 
If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.

--solution

SELECT a.id, b.age, a.coins_needed, a.power
from Wands as a
join Wands_Property as b
ON a.code=b.code
where b.is_evil=0 AND a.coins_needed =(select min(a1.coins_needed)
                                       from wands as a1 join wands_property as b1 
                                      on a1.code=b1.code
                                      where b.age=b1.age and a.power=a1.power)
order by a.`power` desc, b.age desc;
